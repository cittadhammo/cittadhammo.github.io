I mentioned this request to Ajahn Gambhiro who has some experience with AI text editing tools and introduced me to them as well. We actually have an account with ChatGPT here that we can use to pay for some large blocks of text to be edited with some of these tools. Are you looking for something that will work specifically with French? Is it going to be used that much? I tried some of these text editors and they have a free tier which gives you quite a lot to play with if you are just using it occasionally.

Dear Ajahn Gavesako,

Thanks for your email. I asume you are on the Amaravati Publication Comittee.

The project I am involved in is a translation of Ajahn Sumedho's book "The way it is" piloted and initiated by Ajahn Sundara. The main translator is Etienne living in France. 

The manuscript has been entirely reviewed by 2 native French speakers, but I wished to process it to a language corection tools before its publication. Written French is very intricate and I am sure there are still many "mistakes" in the manuscript. If we want  professional quality (right usage of syntax, grammar and orthograph) the best tool I know is Antidote. I have used it in University. In my opinion, none of the member of our team has the skils and level of French of that software. French is "horribly" complicated I am afraid. There is a famous french competitoon for who would be able to do the less mistake in an official dictee...

I think ChatGPT4 might have similar capsbilites if prompted well. For example specifiying the level of French (we use traditional - French Academy) is one of the parametre and what sort of mistake it needs to catch.

The manuscript is ... characters (... words). I could do some testing on one specific chapter and if the outout works well, we could run it trought the entire document.

I will do some resesrch for prompts

What do you think ?

With Metta,
Cittafhammo

Dear Cittadhammo,

Stupid question but do I address it just to Cittadhammo? Iâ€™ll send some stuff to take back home for your family too. Do you need a large backpack? ðŸ˜‰ I promise not to go too mad. Can you send me an Amazon.Uk link to the water colour paper please, otherwise I might get wrong sorry.

Mum is doing much better now, Iâ€™m taking her to Oxford monastery tomorrow and London Saturday and Sunday to visit 2 different Burmese monasteries. Going to be a tiring weekend ðŸ˜‚

Iâ€™ll definitely try to come see you in person before you depart for Switzerland. Itâ€™s always nice to see you and have a natter.

Kind regards,

Yin

Hi Cittadhammo,

Does your mum drink tea? Does she like chocolate, biscuits and sweet things?

Kind regards,

Dear Yin,

Thank you for your email and generous offer. You can post me at the monastery as Cittadhammo Bhikkhu. That will work well.

I do already have a bag (that I made myself :-) which I can wear accross shoulder. Backpack are a bit diffiult with a robe on :_) and I will check if I can find some large hot press water color paper on amazon, I will send you a link if I find it.

For my mother, ha! she is not a great tee drinker at all, but biscuts she would appreciate. A small thing that would fit the space in my bag if possible ;-)

Thank you very much for your help and I wish you the best. Good to know that your mum is going better.

With Metta,
Cittadhammo
