<table><thead><tr><th>Technique</th><th>Full Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Usage</th><th>Drawbacks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MMA</td><td>Manual Metal Arc Welding</td><td>Uses a flux-coated consumable electrode held in the welder's hand. An electric arc forms between the electrode and workpiece. The flux coating melts to form gas and slag to protect the weld.</td><td>Versatile, can weld all metals, including outdoors. Lower cost.</td><td>Slow, requires more skill, slag removal needed after welding.</td></tr><tr><td>MIG</td><td>Metal Inert Gas Welding</td><td>Continuously fed consumable wire electrode feeds through welding gun, with inert shielding gas flowing around the arc to protect the weld.</td><td>Faster welding of light metals like aluminum. Easier to learn. Good for automation.</td><td>Limited metals can be welded. More equipment needed.</td></tr><tr><td>MAG</td><td>Metal Active Gas Welding</td><td>Similar to MIG but uses active shielding gases that chemically interact with the weld pool.</td><td>Faster welding of steel. Deeper weld penetration.</td><td>More expensive shielding gases. Porosity defects can occur.</td></tr><tr><td>GMAW</td><td>Gas Metal Arc Welding</td><td>Encompasses both MIG and MAG welding. A consumable electrode wire feeds continuously. Shielding gas flows around the arc.</td><td>Very versatile - good for many metals with proper electrode wire and shielding gas. Higher deposition rates.</td><td>More expensive equipment. Requires shielding gas.</td></tr></tbody></table>
